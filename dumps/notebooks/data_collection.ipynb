My first question was on the communications \\nvertical. Sir, what near-term catalysts do you see in this vertical which could \\nmeaningfully alter client behavior and what could bring it back to growth? \\nWe've seen almost five quarters of a decline now. So, when do you expect the \\nhistoric capex that the operators have done to trickle down to services? \\nThat's one. And secondly, on the FY '24, another strong quarter. So, do you \\nthink client behavior here is any different to, let's say, BFSI where cost takeout \\nis the main theme? Do you see more adventurous projects here or is the theme \\npretty much similar? Thank you.\"),\n",

One is there is a lot of optimization \\nwork going on. Some of the investments around technology debt have \\nnot taken place. For instance, there's a workaround technology \\nmodernization, mainframe modernization, that spending, and 1 good \\nthing is with the Generative AI becoming more and more mainstream, \\nGenerative AI is also being seen as an important lever through which \\nmodernization could be expedited and accelerated.

What we said is we believe we are \\nconfident that FY25 will be better than FY24. And that is based on how FY24 \\npanned out and how we started seeing the early quarter of FY25. \\nBut it does not mean that the uncertainty has gone away. We still see situations \\nwhere clients are ramping down programs or re-evaluating programs at very \\nshort notice.

It is certainly not \\nphilosophical, but it is quite practical Sudheer. \\nSudheer Guntupalli: \\nAnd the second question is on your other statement that clients are neither \\ngoing for large-scale technology initiatives nor going for deep spending cuts. \\n \\n           Tata Consultancy Services Earnings Conference Call \\nJuly 11, 2024, 19:00 hrs IST  \\n \\n \\n | 14   \\n \\nSo if we were to quantify this qualitative statement, is it fair to say that since \\nthe deep spend cuts are already in the denominator, incrementally not having \\nthem should still be a mathematical tailwind for us in terms of growth? \\nK Krithivasan: \\nSee the way I would characterize this there are long-standing programs. As \\nlong as they are delivering incremental value to our customers, they are \\ncontinuing. And if there is a limited budget available our customers are re-\\nevaluating. Should they be starting a new program which gives a better ROI?  \\nIt could be discretionary program or it could also be a cost optimization \\nprogram as against the next phase of a long-standing program. So whichever \\nis giving them a better ROI is being adopted and lesser ROI programs are \\npassed. So that is the way I characterize it.
