    "5. Includes a \"Sources\" section at the end with all referenced links\n",
    "\n",
    "You can structure your report in a number of different ways. Here are some examples:\n",

    "To answer a question that asks you to compare two things, you might structure your report like this:\n",
    "1/ intro\n",

    "3/ overview of topic B\n",
    "4/ comparison between A and B\n",
    "5/ conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer a question that asks you to return a list of things, you might only need a single section which is the entire list.\n",
    "1/ list of things or table of things\n",
    "Or, you could choose to make each item in the list a separate section in the report. When asked for lists, you don't need an introduction or conclusion.\n",
    "1/ item 1\n",
    "2/ item 2\n",
    "3/ item 3\n",

    "To answer a question that asks you to summarize a topic, give a report, or give an overview, you might structure your report like this:\n",

    "2/ concept 1\n",
    "3/ concept 2\n",

    "REMEMBER: Section is a VERY fluid and loose concept. You can structure your report however you think is best, including in ways that are not listed above!\n",
    "Make sure that your sections are cohesive, and make sense for the reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each section of the report, do the following:\n",
    "- Use simple, clear language\n",
    "- Use ## for section title (Markdown format) for each section of the report\n",
    "- Do NOT ever refer to yourself as the writer of the report. This should be a professional report without any self-referential language. \n",
    "- Do not say what you are doing in the report. Just write the report without any commentary from yourself.\n",
    "- Each section should be as long as necessary to deeply answer the question with the information you have gathered. It is expected that sections will be fairly long and verbose. You are writing a deep research report, and users will expect a thorough answer.\n",
    "- Use bullet points to list out information when appropriate, but by default, write in paragraph form.\n",
    "\n",
    "REMEMBER:\n",

       "  ToolMessage(content='### Critique of the Final Report on Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Financial Analysis and Forecast\\n\\n#### Clarity\\n1. **Section Headings**: The report has clear section headings such as \"Financial Overview,\" \"Management\\'s Outlook,\" \"Significant Risks and Opportunities,\" and \"Qualitative Forecast for Upcoming Quarter.\" This structure aids in navigation and understanding.\\n   \\n2. **Language and Terminology**: The language used is generally clear and accessible, but there are instances where financial jargon could be simplified for a broader audience. For example, terms like \"consolidated revenues\" and \"operational efficiencies\" could benefit from brief explanations or definitions.\\n\\n3. **Bullet Points vs. Narrative**: While the report uses bullet points effectively to present data, it could benefit from more narrative explanations. For instance, instead of just listing revenue growth percentages, the report could elaborate on the implications of these figures for TCS\\'s overall strategy and market position.\\n\\n#### Comprehensiveness\\n1. **Financial Data**: The report provides a good overview of TCS\\'s financial performance, including specific revenue figures and growth percentages. However, it lacks deeper analysis of these figures. For example, it could discuss the impact of currency fluctuations, economic conditions, or sector-specific trends on these results.\\n\\n2. **Management\\'s Outlook**: The section on management\\'s outlook is informative but could be expanded. It would be beneficial to include specific targets or metrics that management has set for the upcoming quarters, as well as how they plan to achieve these goals.\\n\\n3. **Risks and Opportunities**: The report identifies several risks and opportunities, but it could delve deeper into how these factors might interact. For example, how might economic uncertainty affect TCS\\'s ability to capitalize on increased IT spending? A more integrated analysis would provide a clearer picture of the challenges and opportunities ahead.\\n\\n4. **Qualitative Forecast**: The qualitative forecast is a good addition, but it could be more robust. It would be helpful to include specific examples of how TCS plans to sustain demand for digital services or improve operational efficiencies, as well as any anticipated challenges in executing these strategies.\\n\\n#### Overall Quality\\n1. **Structure and Flow**: The report is well-structured, with a logical flow from financial performance to management outlook and risks. However, transitions between sections could be smoother. For instance, linking the management\\'s outlook directly to the identified risks and opportunities would enhance coherence.\\n\\n2. **Depth of Analysis**: While the report covers key areas, it lacks a deeper analytical perspective. For example, discussing how TCS\\'s competitive position compares to its peers in the IT services sector would provide valuable context for its financial performance.\\n\\n3. **Conclusion**: The conclusion summarizes the report well but could be more impactful. It could reiterate the key takeaways and emphasize the importance of the management\\'s proactive approach in navigating the identified risks.\\n\\n4. **Visual Aids**: Incorporating charts or graphs to illustrate financial trends or comparisons could enhance the report\\'s visual appeal and make complex data more digestible.\\n\\n### Recommendations for Improvement\\n- **Expand on Financial Analysis**: Provide deeper insights into the financial data, including external factors influencing performance.\\n- **Enhance Narrative Elements**: Use more narrative explanations to complement bullet points, making the report more engaging and informative.\\n- **Integrate Risks and Opportunities**: Discuss how identified risks and opportunities may interact and impact TCS\\'s strategy.\\n- **Strengthen the Forecast**: Include specific examples and metrics in the qualitative forecast to provide a clearer picture of TCS\\'s future direction.\\n- **Improve Visual Presentation**: Consider adding visual aids to support data and enhance understanding.\\n\\nBy addressing these areas, the report can achieve a higher level of clarity, comprehensiveness, and overall quality, making it a more valuable resource for stakeholders interested in TCS\\'s financial outlook.', name='task', id='d0759283-d6cd-4c0c-aaa0-6ec9e296b9ff', tool_call_id='call_xCojJlMOpFiRfAsoW60zZPoC'),\n",
