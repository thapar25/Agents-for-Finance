The BSNL deal revenue mix might impact margins slightly.\\n*   **Management Outlook:** Management seems cautiously optimistic, reiterating that FY'26 will be better than FY'25. They are proactively offering AI-infused solutions to clients.\\n*   **Risks:** Decision-making deteriorated towards the end of the last quarter, posing risks to the September quarter. Project delays and pauses experienced in the previous quarter might have some carryover effect.\\n*   **Opportunities:** There are opportunities in GenAI, platform modernization, and automation. Integrated digital solutions and modernization projects also present opportunities.
